	<div class="infobox">
		<h1 style="text-align: left;">Welcome to KOTM</h1>
		<h2 style="text-align: left;">What is this/How to use</h2>
		This is a message board with a few big differences. There can only be one message at a time viewable, and everyone is allowed to fight for that spot. Enter your message into the box on the homepage and it will be on the site for all to see until someone else eventually replaces it. Everyone can enter their message as much as they like whenever they like, there is no time limit or anything like that. Anything besides html tags are welcome in the message no matter what it might say. If you want to see a list of every message ever posted you can see the <a href="log.php">log by clicking here.</a>
		<h2 style="text-align: left;">About The Creator</h2>
		<p>This is just a simple sideproject I took on as a way to better familiarize myself with php7. How ever it quickly turned into a project of greater importance (still a sideproject though) after my friends started using it and talking about how they found it interesting and how I should share it on reddit and what not. Oh, silly me, I forgot to introduce myself, my name is Owen and I'm not a computer scientist, I've got no degrees, I've not even finished highschool yet. I'm just a kid that likes to code.**</p>
		<p style="font-size: 8px; text-decoration: underline; text-align: left;">**Very rarely as my <a href="https://github.com/MASTER-SMALL">GitHub</a> makes clear. I'm also no where near a professional level. And also I barely ever finish anything I start.</p>
